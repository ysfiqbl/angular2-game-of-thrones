# Angular 2 Tutorial using Angular CLI and Angular 2 Material

##Overview
This very simple application is my attempt at teaching myself Angular 2 using Angular CLI and Angular 2 Material. I attempt to copy the format of the popular AngularJS Phone Catalog tutorial and do a similar step-by-step Angular 2 application. This application will eventually become a manageable (CRUD) list of Game Thrones characters.

##Prerequisites 
- Git
- Nodejs 4.x or later
- NPM 3.x.x or later

###step-01
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15. This step contains an empty angular2 project generated by angular-cli

#### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

#### Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
